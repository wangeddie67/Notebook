As mentioned before, there are sveral ongoing rojectes that focus on FPGA-sccelarated simulation. The ramp project is a multi-university colaboration that develops open-source FPGA-based simulators and emulators of parallel architectures. The RAMP infrastructure includes a feature that allows for having the inter-component communication channels run as fast as the underlying FPGA hardware will allow, which enables building a range of FPGA simulators from functional emulators, to prototypes and models. The RAMP project has built a number of prototyps, such as RAMP Red and RAMp Blue, and modes such as RAMP Gold. The purpose of these designs ranges from evluating architectures with transactional mmeory support, mesage pasisng machines,

如前文所示，有一些正在进行的项目聚焦于FPGA加速仿真。RAMP项目（多核处理器加速器研究）[5]由多所大学参与，旨在开发开源基于FPGA的为并行架构仿真器和模拟器。RAMP的基础组件提供了这样的特性：
